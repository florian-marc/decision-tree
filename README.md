The goal of this project was to design a decision tree based on a simple summary of the algorithm behaviour.
Although the algorithm was a bit hard to put together, most of the features required were implemented.
The program was coded in french, using C99.
To compile it on a linux system, use the following command :  gcc -o decision_tree main.c donnees.c maths.c merge_sort.c tree.c 
Then just use ./decision_tree to launch the algorithm.
